**What**  
**[divvy](https://github.com/nikhilsrinivasan/divvy-iOS)** makes splitting tabs simple and effortless. Sharing expenses have never been easier - simply login with your Venmo credentials and fire up the app when it's time to settle the tab.

**How**  
Based on the new [iOS Multipeer Connectivity Framework](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/MultipeerConnectivity/Reference/MultipeerConnectivityFramework/_index.html) and tight [Venmo](http://venmo.com) API integration, we were able to develop an application that "just works" with little to no configuration. The Multipeer Connectivity Framework enables discovery services of other nearby iOS devices over Wi-FI networks, peer-to-peer Wi-Fi and Bluetooth personal area networks. Venmo API integration enables us to process payments quickly, easily, and securely unobstrusively, behind the scenes.

**Dependencies**  
[Venmo oAuth API](https://beta-developer.venmo.com/oauth)  
[Venmo App Switch SDK for iOS](https://github.com/venmo/app-switch-ios-framework)  
[ChatHeads](https://github.com/brutella/chatheads)  

**HackMIT 2013**  
We developed a proof of concept of this application under 24 hours as our submission to [hackMIT](http://www.hackmit.org) 2013. The source code of our submission can be found in the [hackMIT branch](https://github.com/nikhilsrinivasan/divvy-iOS/tree/hackMIT-2013).
